# My First HTML/CSS Project 

## Description

* At a younger age i wanted to work with computers and software and actually doing it now feels like a dream come true even though it is a bit difficult for me and sort of a "culture shock".
* Building this project was challenging, but also fun. I built this project to get a better understanding with HTML and CSS and even though i know i made mistakes i still learned more and know i can now implement some CSS along with HTML to begin web building.
* I added semantic HTML elements and changed some CSS properties to make the code better to read, i did end up breaking a part of the website but i will fix it once i have obtained more skill and understanding.
* Doing this project i learned semantic HTML elements, and i understood the values of ID's and classes within the HTML.
 
 ## Usage
